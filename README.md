# John Dailey's Project

-----Week 1 04/04/2014-----
-Create a user and log in
-Game objects can be created
-A games index is visible yet incomplete (going to add better visuals, sorting methods, and actually expand selection).
-I have a couple extra links at the top that do not go anywhere yet (planning for the future).
-I still need to create an admin user that can create games and manage things (anyone can do anything right now).
-Still need to add mock shipping address and payment method
-When a user selects to rent a game and it is sent, update the DB and how many are in stock (maybe create an onhand variable)

-----Week 2 04/11/2014-----
-Most of the time experimenting with Bootstrap
-Created a filter system when viewing all games(will add more)
-Ability to see each game individually and read descruption
-added the onhand variable to games to make it different from numberinstock
-Still need the admin user
-still need to add mock shipping.
